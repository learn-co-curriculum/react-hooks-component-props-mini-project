# Putting it All Together: Components and Props

## Learning Goals

- Create components that return JSX
- Use props to make components dynamic
- Transform lists of data into lists of components

## Overview

Now that you've learned how to work with components in React, it's time to build
something and put those skills to use! Your goal for this lab is to make a
_static site_ in React to practice building components, writing JSX, and passing
down data as props.

We'll be creating a personal blog site, similar to
[Dan Abramov's Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/):

![demo](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-2/react-hooks-component-props-mini-project/demo.png)

There is some starter code available in `src/components/App.js`. There is also
some data in `data/blog.js` that is being imported into `App` so you can pass it
down to the components that need it.

## Deliverables

Have a look at the components below and draw out a component hierarchy so you
can determine how to pass data down as props.

### Header

Make a `Header` component as a child of `App`. It should return:

- a `<header>` element with the following elements inside:
  - an `<h1>` with the name of the blog, passed as a prop called `name`

### About

Make an `About` component as a child of `App`. It should return:

- an `<aside>` element with the following elements inside:
  - an `<img>` element, with the `src` set to an image passed as a prop called
    `image`
  - the `<img>` element should use this placeholder image as a _default value_
    for the prop if no prop is passed in: "https://via.placeholder.com/215"
  - the image should also be accessible! Give it an `alt` attribute of "blog
    logo"
  - a `<p>` element, with the text for the blog passed in as a prop called
    `about`

### ArticleList

Make an `ArticleList` component as a child of `App`. It should return:

- a `<main>` element with the following components inside:
  - an array of `Article` components (one component for each of the `posts`
    passed down as props to `ArticleList`)
  - make sure to assign a unique `key` attribute to each `Article`

### Article

Make an `Article` component as a child of `ArticleList`. It should return:

- an `<article>` element, with the following elements inside:
  - an `<h3>` element displaying the title of the article, passed as a prop
    called `title`
  - a `<small>` element displaying the date of the article, passed as a prop
    called `date`
    - a _default value_ of "January 1, 1970" should be used if no date is passed
      as a prop
  - a `<p>` element displaying the preview of the article, passed as a prop
    called `preview`

### Bonus Feature: 'Minutes to Read'

You'll notice in the original [Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/) site,
there's a 'minutes to read' indicator next to each article.

If the article takes less than 30 minutes to read:

- For every 5 minutes (rounded up to the nearest 5), display a coffee cup emoji.
  For example, if the article takes 3 minutes to read, you should display "‚òïÔ∏è 3
  min read". If the article takes 7 minute, you should display "‚òïÔ∏è‚òïÔ∏è 7 min
  read".

If the article takes 30 minutes or longer to read:

- For every 10 minutes (rounded up to the nearest 10), display a bento box
  emoji. For example, if the article takes 35 minutes to read, you should
  display "üç±üç±üç±üç± 35 min read". If the article takes 61 minutes to read, you
  should display "üç±üç±üç±üç±üç±üç±üç± 61 min read".

There aren't tests for this feature, so you'll have to rely on running the code
in the browser to see if your implementation works!
